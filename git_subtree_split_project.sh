# Take an existing Drupal submodule and split it into its own repository.
# This migrates an all-in-one git blob Drupal project
# into something that can be better handled via makefiles.
#
# And makes things built in one site possible to be re-used properly in
# other sites, if the developer had not been doing that before!
#
# It extracts the history of the target directory (only) and makes a new project
# folder for it (nearby)
# It then pushes that project into the remote git repo.
# Then it returns to the main project, removes the folder, then REPLACES
# it by including the new remote project in its place.
#
# Run this from the docroot of a clean site checkout.
# Give it the PROJECT_NAME and PROJECT_PATH and new GIT_URI of the submodule to hit.
# You will need to create a central, remote git repo manually first!
# ..probably in the project on gitorious.

# Example values:
PROJECT_NAME=promotions
PROJECT_PATH=sites/all/modules/sparks/promotions
GIT_URI=git@git.sparksinteractive.co.nz:national-party-mp-sites/promotions.git
PROJECT_BRANCH=7.x-1.x
